# ngCardMatch

A simple [card matching game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)) built with Angular 4!

## Running a Local Instance of ngCardMatch

Ensure you have [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.2 or later installed globally so you can access the `ng` command from any command prompt.

Clone this repo locally, and run `npm i` from root.

When that's all done, run `ng serve` from root for a live dev server. Navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

When running a local server, you can use [Augury](https://augury.angular.io/) for Chrome to view and inspect the state of services and components
